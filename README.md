Simple project to train usage of API's

This is a simple project created to showcase the usage of API's. My goal was to get a hold of basic js, not focusing on styling and design, therefore the page is not responsive.

I've used NBP (National Polish Bank) data (which is why the default currency is PLN) about currencies and gold prices and displayed them with help of html, css and simple js.

The graphs have been created with use of Plotly.js.

If You have any questions feel free to contact me on github.

Enjoy!
